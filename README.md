## Dynamodb
- Fully managed NoSQL database 
- offers encryption at rest
- scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation
- provides on-demand backup capabili
- data is stored on SSD and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones
- global tables to keep DynamoDB tables in sync across AWS Regions
- SDK 
    - Interfaces: Low Level, Document , Object Persistance 
- Throughput settings:
    - specify its provisioned throughput capacity. DynamoDB uses this information to reserve sufficient system resources
    - Optionally use autoscaling and let DynamoDb decide
    - Read Capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second for 4kb
    - A write capacity unit represents one write per second, for an item up to 1 KB in size.
    - For excess in Read and Write Capacity units, DynamoDb will throttle the request and return exception
    - DynamoDb can use Burst capcaity to accomodate these excess units
- Considerations in throughput settings:
    - Item sizes
    - Expected read and write request rates.
    - Read consistency requirements
- Autoscaling
    - As soon as capacity exceeds the requrirment, cloudwatch triggers and alarm
    - Notification sent to user
    - Cloudwatch alarm invokes update table command
- The Query operation finds items based on primary key values. 
- A Scan operation reads every item in a table or a secondary index. 
- Seconddary Index:
    - Secondary index is an alternative key to support queries on an item apart from primary key
    - Associated with only one table called base table.
    - Attributes can be projected or copied from base table
    - Consist of partition key and sort key
    - Two types
        - Local SI: Same PK but different SK  compared to basetable
        - Global SI: Different PK and SK
- Streams:
    -  captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table, and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours
    -  ordered flow of information about changes to items in an Amazon DynamoDB table
    -  Each stream record appears exactly once in the stream.
    - Same sequence
    - AWS maintains separate endpoints for DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams. 
- Backup and Recover:
    -  you can restore that table to any point in time during the last 35 day
- GLobal table:
    - deploying a multi-region, multi-master database, without having to build and maintain your own replication solution. 
- Encryption at rest is done throught AWS KMS
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX): delivers fast response times for accessing eventually consistent data.
    - As an in-memory cache, DAX reduces the response times of eventually-consistent read workloads by an order of magnitude, from single-digit milliseconds to microseconds.
    - for read-heavy and bursty workloads
    - Ideal for 
        - Fastest possible read time ( gaming site, trading, etc)
        - Need small items more frequently ( example sale )
        - Read intensive and cost sensitive data
        - Divert long running read intensive applications to DAX
- Limits
    - Table per account: 256 per region (Initial)
    - SI : 5 LSI and 5 GSI, Total number of projected attributes = 20
    - Max length of partition key 2048 bytes

### EBS volume types:
- Terms
    - Baseline performance is the IOPS at which volume operates without burst
    - Burst is the extra IOPS provisioned when more IO happens
    - Initial Credit balance is balance of I/O which gets depleted when using burst
    - Throughput = Volume size * I/O Size (in KiB) * I/O rate
- General Purpose SSD (gp2):
    - 1GiB-16Tib
    - 100 IOPS - 10000 IOPS ( 3 IOPS/GiB)
    - One I/O size limit- 256KiB/s
    - Max through put - 160MiB/s (min size = 214GiB, from T=VIR)
    - Burst@3000 IOPS
    - Initial credit balance - 5.4 Million IOC
    - Baseline performance = 3*GiB
    - Burst IOPS is used when more IO operations are needed
    - Initial credit balance is used to calculate the max duration of burst
    - For GiB > 1000, Burst duration is infinite
    - Test and devlopment environments
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1):
    - 4GiB-16TiB
    - Does not use credit burst model
    - User specifiy the specify a consistent IOPS rate.
    - Throughput limit of 1 IO - 256 KiB/s

    - Stateful, if request goes out, the response can come in without creating additional rule
    - Apply rules any time and applied immediately
- Private IP
    - Private IP not reachable over internet
    - Each instance is given internally resolvable dns host name
    - Also can specify secondary private addresses
- Public IP
    - public ip mapped to private ip with NAT
    - instances in default vpc is public ip
    - instances in non default vpc is private ip by default
    - PIP is released on stop and when EIP is associated. In both cases, assigns a new one
- EIP
    - Can be associated with one resource and then assigned to another one
    - When EIP is disassociated, it still remains allocated
    - When instance is running, EIP is not charged
    - Else, stopped and disassociated EIP are charged
- ENI
    - Represents network card attached to an instance
    - Each instance has one primary network interface (eth0) by default which cannot be deleted
    - ENI can be attached and detached to other instance
    - Use Case: Management Network, Load Balancers, High Availability, Dual Homed Instance 
- Placement Groupss:
    - determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware. When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
        - Clusterâ€”clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone

        - Spreadâ€”spreads instances across underlying hardware
